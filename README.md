# Visualization for the spread of COVID in the continental US

Using data from the New York Times on new COVID cases from each state in the US, I constructed maps for each week of 2020. I aggregated and munged the data which produced the `states_by_cases` text file in this repository. 
The `shapes` directory contains the shape files necessary for Basemap to properly construct the ma and boundaries of the United States. This was originally developed in a Jupyter Notebook which I reworked into a python script for ease of use.
Thank you for taking the time to check out my visualization, any feedback is appreciated!
